# Intracranial-Haemorrhage-Classification-and-Segmentation

Early diagnosis of intracranial haemorrhages is of monumental importance, with a mortality rate of 
approximately 35% to 52%, occurring within the first 30 days, with most deaths occurring within 
2 days of the initial bleed; exhibiting prominence regarding detection, diagnosis, and intervention. 

To aid early diagnosis, the application of machine learning and image processing techniques can be used, 
producing a deep convolutional neural network and image segmentation program, based on 
thresholding Hounsfield Unit values. 

Presenting viable data, such as presence, location, and haemorrhage type, aiding doctors diagnose 
the haemorrhage and decide upon the best course of treatment.
